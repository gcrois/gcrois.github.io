Kata is an open source and cross-platform ecosystem for developing software on desktop, web, mobile, and other targets. For example, these are all supported use cases:

  * Develop an application, and deploy to native, web, and mobile targets from a single source
  * Write an internal developer utility and embed it in your project
  * Write your own programming language (for example, a [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)) that seamlessly integrates with the Kata stack

Kata includes a few sub-projects to help that happen:

  * KataIR (`kir` CLI, `*.kir` files): a target-agnostic and language-agnostic intermediate representation (IR) that can be "lowered" and eventually compiled into runnable code
  * KataScript (`ks` CLI, `*.ks` files): a high-level scripting language that is dynamic and boxed by default, with very expressive syntax
  * KataCompiled (`kc` CLI, `*.kc` files): a low-level language with both static and dynamic typing support, as well as unboxed ("native") values
  * KataPackageManager (`kpm` CLI, `*.kpm` files)


This website is still a work-in-progress, so make sure to check it out!
