Kata is an open source and cross-platform ecosystem for developing software on desktop, web, mobile, and other targets. For example, these are all supported use cases:

  * Develop an application, and deploy to native, web, and mobile targets from a single source
  * Write an internal developer utility and embed it in your project
  * Write your own programming language (for example, a [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)) that seamlessly integrates with the Kata stack

You should check out:

  * [KataScript (`ks` CLI, `*.ks` files)](https://ks.kata.tools), for writing most applications (it's easy to get started)
  * [KataCompiler (`kc` CLI, `*.kc` files)](https://kc.kata.tools), for writing system-level or kernel-level utilities
  * TODO... add more
