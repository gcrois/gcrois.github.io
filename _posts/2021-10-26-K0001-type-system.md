buckle up! we're about to deep dive into the world of types, values, templates, and math. particularly, how they are used in the Kata languages and internally how they work

<!--more-->

![type graph 0](/files/src/K0001/types0.dot.webp)

the above figure is a graph of some types and templates in the Kata type system. each node represents a type (if round) or a template (if octogonal). each node represents a base-extends type relationship (if solid), a type-template relationship (if dotted `. . .`), and/or an automatically decay-able/cast-able type (if dashed `- - -`).


for example:

  * `u32`: a 32-bit unsigned integer
  * `f32`: a 32-bit floating point number (`float` in C)
  * `string`: an immutable shared string of Unicode characters
  * `array[T]`: a template that generates a mutable array container type, with elements of type `T`
  * `maybe[T]`: a template that generates a container type that can either contain a value of type `T` or be empty
  * `union[*T]`: a template that generates a container type that can be any of `*T` (which is 1-or-more types)
